# House_Price_Prediction
This data science project aims to create a real estate price prediction website. The realization of the website is divided into different steps:


 -Building a Sklearn and linear regression model using the Banglore house price dataset from kaggle.com. (During model building, we cover almost all data science concepts, such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, etc. )
 
 -Build a Python Flask server that uses the storage model to handle HTTP requests.
 
 -Create a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
